## Notes

When publishing for the first time, run this
command locally:

```
quarto publish gh-pages
```

### Running Cells

Please not we want cells within the course to actually run. So you may see a format like this in how the course notes are written:

``` `

# This writes the code snippet at the
# bottom to a file
```{python}
#| echo: false
#| output: false
%%writefile ../scripts/script.py

print("Hello from Python")
```
# This includes the contents of that file
# in the notes
```{.python include="../scripts/script.py" filename="script.py"} 
```
