Start by deleting all the lines inside the file data.txt.

We then edit the end of the script where it calculates the mean so that it only runs if the count is greater than zero:

```{python}
#| filename: file.py
#| eval: false
total = 0
count = 0

with open("data.txt") as f:
    for line in f:
        number = int(line)
        total += number
        count += 1

print("Sum of all", count, "values is:", total)

if count > 0:
    mean = total / count
    print("The mean is", mean)
```

```{.bash}
python file.py
```

```{python}
#| echo: false
total = 0
count = 0

with open("../data/data2.txt") as f:
    for line in f:
        number = int(line)
        total += number
        count += 1

print("Sum of all", count, "values is:", total)

if count > 0:
    mean = total / count
    print("The mean is", mean)
```
