Starting with creating our data file `data.txt`:

```{.txt filename="data.txt"}
12
54
7
332
54
1
0
```

As before we start with defining a variable `count` to start at zero. We increase it by `1` each time around the loop and print it out at the end:

```{python}
#| filename: file.py
#| eval: false
total = 0
count = 0

with open("data.txt") as f:
    for line in f:
        number = int(line)
        total += number
        count += 1

print("Sum of all", count, "values is:", total)
```

```{.bash}
python file.py
```

```{python}
#| echo: false


total = 0
count = 0

with open("../data/data.txt") as f:
    for line in f:
        number = int(line)
        total += number
        count += 1

print("Sum of all", count, "values is:", total)


```
