Starting with creating our data file `data.txt`:

```{.txt filename="data.txt"}
12
54
7
332
54
1
0
```

The logic in this script is identical but instead of having `total`, `count` and `mean` as separate variables, we have collected them into a single dictionary:

```{python}
#| filename: file.py
#| eval: false
stats = {"sum": 0, "count": 0}

with open("data.txt") as f:
    for line in f:
        number = int(line)
        stats["sum"] += number
        stats["count"] += 1

if stats["count"] > 0:
    stats["mean"] = stats["sum"] / stats["count"]

print(stats)
```

```{.bash}
python file.py
```

```{python}
#| filename: file.py
#| eval: false
stats = {"sum": 0, "count": 0}

with open("../data/data.txt") as f:
    for line in f:
        number = int(line)
        stats["sum"] += number
        stats["count"] += 1

if stats["count"] > 0:
    stats["mean"] = stats["sum"] / stats["count"]

print(stats)
```
