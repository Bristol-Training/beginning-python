Starting with creating our data file `data.txt`:

```{.txt filename="data.txt"}
12
54
7
332
54
1
0
```



We start by defining an integer, `total` to be zero before the loop. Inside the loop we add the line of code `total += number` which increases the variable `total` by the value in the variable `number`.

Finally we print the total:

```{python}
#| filename: file.py
#| eval: false


total = 0

with open("data.txt") as f:
    for line in f:
        number = int(line)
        total += number

print("Sum of all values is:", total)
```

```{.bash}
python file.py
```

```{python}
#| echo: false


total = 0

with open("../data/data.txt") as f:
    for line in f:
        number = int(line)
        total += number

print("Sum of all values is:", total)


```
