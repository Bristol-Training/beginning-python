Starting with creating our data file `data.txt`:

```{.txt filename="data.txt"}
12
54
7
332
54
1
0
```

We have changed just one line so that it now has * 10 rather than + 17:

```{python}
#| filename: file.py
#| eval: false
with open("data.txt") as f:
    for line in f:
        number = int(line)
        new_number = number * 10
        print(new_number)
```

```{.bash}
python file.py
```

```{python}
#| echo: false
with open("../data/data.txt") as f:
    for line in f:
        number = int(line)
        new_number = number * 10
        print(new_number)
```
