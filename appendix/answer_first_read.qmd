Starting with creating our data file `data.txt`:

```{.txt filename="data.txt"}
12
54
7
332
54
1
0
```

We then write a short script to open the data file, loop over its lines and print each in-turn. The only thing that has been changed here is the argument being passed to `open()`:

```{python}
#| filename: file.py
#| eval: false
with open("data.txt") as f:
    for line in f:
        print(line, end="")
```

```{.bash}
python file.py
```

```{python}
#| filename: file.py
#| echo: false
with open("../data/data.txt") as f:
    for line in f:
        print(line, end="")
```
