We have moved the string out of the parentheses and into a named variable, `words`. We then pass this variable to the function:


```{python}
#| filename: script.py
words = "Hello Matt"

print(words)
```


When we run our script we see that the output has not changed, as expected:


```{.bash filename="Terminal/Command Prompt"}
python script.py
```

```{python}
#| echo: false
words = "Hello Matt"

print(words)
```
