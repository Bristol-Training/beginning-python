We have moved the string out of the parentheses and into a named variable, `words`. We then pass this variable to the function:



```{.python include="../scripts/script3.py" filename="script.py"}
```


When we run our script we see that the output has not changed, as expected:


```{.bash filename="Terminal/Command Prompt"}
python script.py
```

```{python}
#| echo: false
%run ../scripts/script3.py
```
