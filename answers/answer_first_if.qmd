```{.python include='../scripts/if2.py' filename='if.py'}
```


If `my_number` is smaller than 100 then the expression is false and so the `if` does not trigger and nothing is printed:


```{.bash filename="Terminal/Command Prompt"}
python if.py
```

```{python}
#| echo: false
%run ../scripts/if2.py {42}

```
