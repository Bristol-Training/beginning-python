##### Adding more items to the list makes the loop go around more times

```{python}
#| filename: loop.py
#| output: false
my_words = ["Hello", "Python", "Goodbye", "Python"]

for word in my_words:
    print(word)
    
```


```{.bash}
python loop.py
```

```{python}
#| filename: loop.py
#| echo: false
my_words = ["Hello", "Python", "Goodbye", "Python"]

for word in my_words:
    print(word)
```


##### A list with a mixture of data types can be printed witout issue


```{python}
#| filename: loop.py

my_words = ["Hello", "Python", 404, "Goodbye", "Python", 42]

for word in my_words:
    print(word)
```


##### Looping over an empty list does not print anything

```{python}
#| filename: loop.py
#| 
my_words = []

for word in my_words:
    print(word)
```
