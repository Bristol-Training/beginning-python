We make two strings. One called `first_phrase` and second called `second_phrase`. We then make a third variable called `message` by adding together (using the `+` symbol) the other two. This combines the strings together into a new, longer string:


```{python}
#| filename: script.py
#| output: false

first_phrase = "The Battle of Hastings "
second_phrase = "was in 1066"

message = first_phrase + second_phrase

print(message)
```


Again, when we run our code, the output has not changed, as expected:


```{.bash filename="Terminal/Command Prompt"}
run script.py
```

```{python}
#| filename: script.py
#| echo: false

first_phrase = "The Battle of Hastings "
second_phrase = "was in 1066"

message = first_phrase + second_phrase

print(message)
```
