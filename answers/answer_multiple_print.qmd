The variables `first_phrase` and `second_phrase` are almost unchanged. The only difference is that `first_phrase` no longer has the extra space at the end of it.

We pass these two variables as two arguments to `print()`, separating them by commas. `print()` will automatically add spaces between each argument when displaying the output.

```{.python include="../scripts/script4.py" filename="script.py"}
```

Once more, when we run our code, the output has not changed, as expected:


```{.bash filename="Terminal/Command Prompt"}
run script.py
```

```{python}
#| echo: false

%run ../scripts/script4.py
```
