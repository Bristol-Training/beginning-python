We make a list and then select a few slices of it:


```{python}
#| filename: list.py
#| output: false
my_list = [3, 5, "green", 5.3, "house", 100, 1]

print(my_list[2:4])
print(my_list[3:-2])
print(my_list[0:1])
print(my_list[-4:-1])

```

This selects everything from the number 2 index up to, but not including the number 4 index, i.e. the 2 and 3 indexes:

```python
[2:4]
```

This starts at index 3 and goe as far as index -2 (which is the same as index 5 in this list):

```python
[3:-2]
```

This starts at the beginning of the list and stops before index 1, giving us a list with just one item:

```python
[0:1]
```

This starts at index -4 (i.e. index 3) and goes until index -1 (i.e. index 6):

```python
[-4:-1]
```


```{.bash filename="Terminal/Command Prompt"}
python list.py
```

```{python}
#| filename: list.py
#| echo: false
my_list = [3, 5, "green", 5.3, "house", 100, 1]

print(my_list[2:4])
print(my_list[3:-2])
print(my_list[0:1])
print(my_list[-4:-1])

```
