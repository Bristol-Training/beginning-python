Starting with the same list we used before, each item in the list gets printed on its own line.

```{python }
#| filename: loop.py
words = ["Hello", "Python"]

for word in words:
    print(word)
```


On the contrary, if we loop over a string we see that each character gets printed on its own line.
```{python}
#| filename: loop.py
phrase = "Hello Python"

for letter in phrase:
    print(letter)

```
