We start with the same list we had in the chapter.

```{python }
#| filename: loop.py
#| output: false
words = ["Hello", "Python"]

for word in words:
    print(word)
```

Each item in the list gets printed on its own line:


```{.bash filename="Terminal/Command Prompt"}
python loop.py
```

```{python}
#| filename: loop.py
#| echo: false
words = ["Hello", "Python"]

for word in words:
    print(word)
```

If we loop over a string:


```{python}
#| filename: loop.py
#| output: false
phrase = "Hello Python"

for letter in phrase:
    print(letter)

```

We see that each character in the string gets printed on its own line:

```{.bash filename="Terminal/Command Prompt"}
python loop.py
```
```{python}
#| filename: loop.py
#| echo: false
phrase = "Hello Python"

for letter in phrase:
    print(letter)
    
```
