We start with the same list we had in the chapter.

```{.python include="../scripts/loops8.py" filename="loop.py"}
```

Each item in the list gets printed on its own line:


```{.bash filename="Terminal/Command Prompt"}
python loop.py
```

```{python}
#| echo: false
%run ../scripts/loops8.py
```


If we loop over a string:


```{.python include="../scripts/loops9.py" filename="loop.py"}
```

We see that each character in the string gets printed on its own line:

```{.bash filename="Terminal/Command Prompt"}
python loop.py
```

```{python}
#| echo: false
%run ../scripts/loops9.py
```
